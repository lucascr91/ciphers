Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964, the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Theodore Jørgensen. His biological great-grandfather John Jørgensen, born 8 January 1872 on the small island of Samsø, then in Holbæk County, Zealand, today a municipality in the Central Denmark Region, Denmark, immigrated around 1900 to Chicago, where he had a son, Theodore "Ted" John Jorgensen (b. 1917) with his wife, Ida Minnie Jorgensen, who was also born in Denmark. This son was the father of Ted Jorgensen (b. 1944), Jeff Bezos' biological father.[better source needed] At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student and his father was 19. After completing high school despite challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended night school while bringing baby Jeff along. After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968. Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.
