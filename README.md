This is a package in Rust that implements basics encryption algorithms. Details on the the algorithms implemented can be found in this [book](http://inventwithpython.com/cracking/). Here is the complete list of algos and their respective status of implementation.

| Name                   	| status     	|
|------------------------	|------------	|
| Caesar cipher          	|    done    	|
| Transposition Cipher   	|    done   	|
| File encrypting        	| to be done 	|
| Affine Cipher          	| to be done 	|
